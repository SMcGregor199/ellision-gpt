### "The World and the Jug" – Excerpt 1 

> "First, three questions: Why is it so often true that when critics confront the American as *Negro*
> they suddenly drop their advanced critical armament and revert with an air of confident superiority > to quite primitive modes of analysis? Why is it that sociology-oriented critics seem to rate 
> literature so far below politics and ideology that they would rather kill a novel than modify their
> presumptions concerning a given reality which it seeks in its own terms to project? Finally, why 
> is it that so many of those who would tell us the meaning of Negro life never bother to learn how
> varied it really is?" - Ralph Ellison, “The World and the Jug”, in *The Collected Essays of Ralph 
> Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.

### "The World and the Jug" – Excerpt 2

> "Wright believed in the much abused idea that novels are "weapons"—the counterpart of the dreary notion, common
> among most minority groups, that novels are instruments of good public relations. But I believe that true
> novels, even when most pessimistic and bitter, arise out of an impulse to celebrate human life and therefore
> are ritualistic and ceremonial at their core. Thus they would preserve as they destroy, affirm as they reject. 
> -"Ralph Ellison, “The World and the Jug”, in *The Collected Essays of Ralph 
> Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.

### *Invisible Man* – Excerpt 1 

> "I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am 
> I one of your Hollywood-movie extoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber
> and liquids -- and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply
> because poeople refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows,
> it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach
> me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination -- indeed, everything
> and anything except me." — Ralph Ellison, "Prologue," *Invisible Man*, Modern Library, 1995. Kindle edition.

### *Invisible Man* – Excerpt 2

> "In my hole in the basement there are exactly 1,369 lights. I've wired the entire ceiling, every inch of
> it. And not with flourescent bulbs, but with the older, more-expensive-to-operate kind, the filament type.
> An act of sabotage, you know. I've already begun to write the wall. A junk man I know, a man of vision,
> has supplied me with wire and sockets. Nothing, storm or flood, must get in the way of our need for light
> and ever more and brighter light. The truth is the light and the light is the truth. When I finish all
> four walls, then I'll start on the floor." — Ralph Ellison, "Prologue," *Invisible Man*, 
> Modern Library, 1995. Kindle edition.

### "The Shadow and the Act" – Excerpt 1

> "We are recalling all this not so much as a means of indicting Hollywood as by way of placing 
> *Intruder in the Dust*, and such recent fils as *Home of the Brave*, *Lost Boundaries* and
> *Pinky*, in perspective. To direct an attack upon Hollywood would indeed be to confuse
> portrayal with action, image with reality. In the beginning was not the shadow but the act, 
> and the province of Holly is not action, but illusion. Actually, the anti-Negro images of the films
> were (and are) acceptable because of the existence throughout the United States of an audience 
> obssessed with an inner psychological need to view Negroes as less than men. Thus, psychologically
> and ethically, these negative images constitute justifications for all those acts, legal, 
> emotional, economic, and political, which we label Jim Crow. The anti-Negro image is a ritual
> object of which Hollywood is not the creator, but the manipulator. Its role has been that of 
> justifying the widely held myth of Negro unhumanness and inferiority by offering entertaining
> rituals through which that myth could be reaffirmed. - Ralph Ellison, “The Shadow and the Act”, in 
> *The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.
