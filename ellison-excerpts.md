### "The World and the Jug" – Excerpt 1

> "First, three questions: Why is it so often true that when critics confront the American as *Negro*
> they suddenly drop their advanced critical armament and revert with an air of confident superiority > to quite primitive modes of analysis? Why is it that sociology-oriented critics seem to rate 
> literature so far below politics and ideology that they would rather kill a novel than modify their
> presumptions concerning a given reality which it seeks in its own terms to project? Finally, why 
> is it that so many of those who would tell us the meaning of Negro life never bother to learn how
> varied it really is?"
> — Ralph Ellison, “The World and the Jug,” in *The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison*, ed. John F.Callahan, Modern Library, 2011. Kindle edition.
