# The Ralph Ellison Companion – Custom GPT

**The Ralph Ellison Companion** is an AI-powered interpretive engine designed to explore the language, themes, and legacy of Ralph Ellison’s *Invisible Man*.

Built as a companion tool for students, scholars, and the curious reader, this custom GPT offers generative dialogue, contextual insight, and literary resonance rooted in the text.

It is not a substitute for Ellison’s words—but a means of listening differently, dialoguing across time, and uncovering the shadows and signals within one of the most important novels of the 20th century.

## 🧪 Sample Prompts (Why They Matter)

The `sample-prompts.md` file contains curated examples of how Ellison GPT responds to different kinds of questions—interpretive, comparative, and redirection-based. These samples:

- Reinforce the GPT’s tone, boundaries, and citation style  
- Serve as reference points for quality assurance and prompt refinement  
- Showcase the project’s ethos: to support inquiry without oversimplifying Ellison’s thought  

Example prompt:
> **What does Ellison mean by invisibility?**  
> → GPT returns an excerpt-grounded reflection on social erasure, identity, and literary metaphor.

These examples ensure the GPT responds with care, context, and critical attention to language.
