# The Ralph Ellison Companion – Custom GPT

**The Ralph Ellison Companion** is an AI-powered interpretive engine designed to explore the language, themes, and legacy of Ralph Ellison’s *Invisible Man*.

Built as a companion tool for students, scholars, and the curious reader, this custom GPT offers generative dialogue, contextual insight, and literary resonance rooted in the text.

It is not a substitute for Ellison’s words—but a means of listening differently, dialoguing across time, and uncovering the shadows and signals within one of the most important novels of the 20th century.
